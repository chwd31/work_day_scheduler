# Work Day Scheduler

This project was intented to create a scheduling application for the browser to be used during the work day.  The application was to use jQuery and Day.js to create a real time scheduling application.  The scheduler features hour blocks from the business hours of 9-5 with previous and next day scheduling capabilities.  The application also stores any entered data into local storage that can be retrieved. 

## Installation

## Usage
This application is used to schedule out a busy workday based on user input.  The scheduler was created to meet the following criteria:
### User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
### Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
