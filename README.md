# Work Day Scheduler

This project was intented to create a scheduling application for the browser to be used during the work day.  The application was to use jQuery and Day.js to create a real time scheduling application.  The scheduler features hour blocks from the business hours of 9-5 with previous and next day scheduling capabilities.  The application also stores any entered data into local storage that can be retrieved. 

## Installation

The JavaScript Quiz can be found at https://chwd31.github.io/Quiz_Challenge/  

No other installation is necessary.

## Usage
This application is used to schedule out a busy workday based on user input.  The scheduler was created to meet the following criteria:

### User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
WHEN I open the planner  
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  
WHEN I scroll down  
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours  
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day  
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  
WHEN I click into a timeblock  
THEN I can enter an event  
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock  
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN the saved events persist
